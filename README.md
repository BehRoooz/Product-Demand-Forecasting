# Product Demand Forecasting using ARIMA:

The dataset contains historical product demand for a manufacturing company with footprints globally. The company provides thousands of products within dozens of product categories. There are four central warehouses to ship products within the region it is responsible for. Since the products are manufactured in different locations all over the world, it normally takes more than one month to ship products via ocean to different central warehouses.

If forecasts for each product in different central with reasonable accuracy for the monthly demand for month after next can be achieved, it would be beneficial to the company in multiple ways.

The forecasting model is created using SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), which is a variation of ARIMA that extends ARIMA to handle seasonality in time series data.

ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a popular time series forecasting model that combines autoregression, differencing, and moving average components to make predictions about future points in a time series.
